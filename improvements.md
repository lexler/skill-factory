# Nullables Skill Improvements

## Examples

- [ ] **Show failure case in main example** — Current CommandLine example only shows success. Add one test showing error configuration.

- [ ] **Add Python example** — All examples are JavaScript. The pattern is language-agnostic; showing a second language would reinforce this.

## Test Patterns Reference

- [ ] **Add "expect.any()" portability warning more prominently** — The note about Jest-specific matchers is buried at the end. Move to where timestamp examples appear.

## Migration Reference

- [ ] **Add concrete "Find mocks" commands for more frameworks** — Currently only shows generic grep. Add specific patterns for Jest, Sinon, etc.
