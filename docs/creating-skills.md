# Creating Skills

## Process

1. Read documentation in `docs/knowledge/anthropic-skill-docs/`:
   - `overview.md` - Core concepts
   - `skills.md` - Implementation patterns
   - `best-practices.md` - Guidelines and pitfalls
   - `quickstart.md` - Getting started

2. Create skill following official Anthropic patterns

3. Save to `output_skills/[skill-name]/`
   - Each skill should be self-contained in its own directory
   - Use a clear, descriptive name for the skill folder

## Documentation

Always reference the official Anthropic documentation when creating skills to ensure compliance with current best practices and patterns.
