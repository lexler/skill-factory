# Final Review

Push to the limit.

1. Read through refactored code start to finish
2. Find anything that still bothers you
3. For each issue: can I fix without changing behavior?
   - Yes → implement now
   - No → note for future

After implementing all you can find, note what's beyond refactoring's reach (requires behavior changes).
